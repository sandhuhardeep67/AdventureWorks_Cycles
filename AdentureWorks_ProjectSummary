ðŸš´ Power BI Dashboard for AdventureWorks Cycles
I'm excited to share my recent Business Intelligence project for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment. This Power BI dashboard is a powerful tool designed to help management track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profits, revenue, and return rates.

Project Goals:
Comparing regional performance.
Analyzing product-level trends.
Identifying high-value customers.

Tools and Techniques:
Power BI: For data connection, transformation, and visualization.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating measures for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Data Modeling: Built relational data models to integrate raw data.

Dashboard Pages and Key Insights:
Executive Dashboard
Regional Map
Product Details
Customer Details

For every visual on the dashboard, DAX measures were calculated, including:
-Percentage of all orders
-90-days rolling profit
-Average retail price
-High ticket orders
-Previous month profit/orders/revenue
-Total cost/profit/revenue
-Price adjustments using modeling and many more.

You can find detailed information about the measures used in this project on added file to this respository.

This dataset helped me to explore Power BI at a deeper level and pull out the much required insights.
